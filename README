libenvpreload is a library which if loaded by a program, will read the
file /etc/X11/environment, and set the veriables defined in there.
Xorg can be made to load it by adding it to the module section,
`make install` will do that for you. As to why not to just use
/etc/environment, some display managers such as lightdm, gdm, etc.
tend to clear the environment, and don't seam to provide an option
to add anv variables, so if some MESA env variables are needed
to get that thing even started or to fix a problem, this was 
the best way I could come up with to make that possible.
